            <h1>angels dance upon skyscrapers of the heart.</h1>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">I haven't written many love poems since I've been with you,
              I squirm alone,
              frown alone,
              revive myself alone,
              loathe myself
              and snatch myself away.
              Yet, not a single line of poetry emerges.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">Suffering isn't poetry,
              but usually, I at least feel inspired,
              So angry that I write in my diary,
              So sad that I stand and make peace.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">
              But I sit in silence,
              feeling happy but unsure,
              Joyful but then feeling guilty,
              In love but often feeling mismatched,
              Wanting you close but feeling repulsive.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">Not sure what I want or what's right,
              Too deep to tell anyone that I've changed my mind,
              Everyone's advice is so good, but it never sticks,
              I always say I'll reach for the stars, but then I'm always content with star-shaped flowers.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">I tell myself I'll change today,
              I said that yesterday,
              and the week before,
              month before,
              year before
              and years before.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="chapone-para">I've said I want to change,
              countless times
              so many it feels impossible now.</h4>
