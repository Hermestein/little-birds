            <h4>My darling, I have much to say
              <br/>
              Where o precious one shall I begin ?
              <br/>
              All that is in you is princely
              <br/> 
              O you who makes of my words through their meaning
              </h4>
              <h4>Cocoons of silk
                <br />
                These are my songs and this is me
                <br />
                This short book contains us
                <br />
                Tomorrow when I return its pages
                <br />
                A lamp will lament
                <br />
                A bed will sing
              </h4>
              <h4>Its letters from longing will turn green
                <br />
                  Its commas be on the verge of flight
                  <br />
                  Do not say: why did this youth
                  <br />
                  Speak of me to the winding road and the stream
                  <br />
                  The almond tree and the tulip
                  <br />
                  So that the world escorts me wherever I go ?
                  <br />
                  Why did he sing these songs ?
              </h4>
              <h4>Now there is no star
                <br />
                That is not perfumed with my fragrance
                <br />
                Tomorrow people will see me in his verse
                <br />
                A mouth the taste of wine, close-cropped hair
                <br />
                Ignore what people say
                <br />
                You will be great only through my great love
                <br />
                What would the world have been if we had not been
                <br />
                If your eyes had not been, what would the world have been?
                <br />
